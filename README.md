## How to Run

Open `index.html` directly in your browser, or run the project using a static server such as Live Server.

You can also run it with:

```bash
npx serve .
```

This project does not require any build step.

## How to Change the WhatsApp Number

Open `js/products.js`, then update the following value:

```javascript
const STORE_CONFIG = {
  whatsappNumber: "6281234567890"
};
```

Use the international phone number format without the `+` symbol.

## How to Add a New Product

Open `js/products.js`, then add a new object to the `UC_PRODUCTS` array. Make sure each product has a unique `id`, name, category, price, rating, stock data, size, color, image, description, details, created date, sold count, and SKU.

Example:

```javascript
{
  id: 21,
  name: "New Product Name",
  category: "Men",
  type: "Shirt",
  price: 199000,
  compareAt: 249000,
  rating: 4.7,
  reviews: 20,
  inStock: true,
  stock: 12,
  badge: "New",
  colors: ["Black", "White"],
  sizes: ["S", "M", "L"],
  images: ["assets/images/product-shirt.svg"],
  description: "Product description.",
  details: ["First detail", "Second detail"],
  createdAt: "2026-07-14",
  sold: 10,
  sku: "URB-NEW-021"
}
```

## Project Purpose

This project was created to practice frontend development skills by building a practical, user-focused e-commerce interface. It demonstrates multi-page layout structure, DOM manipulation, responsive design, product filtering, cart management, form validation, and LocalStorage-based state management.
